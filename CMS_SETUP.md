# CMS Setup Guide

## Overview
Your website is now fully CMS-ready using Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS). All content can be managed through a user-friendly interface without touching code.

## Accessing the CMS
- Navigate to `/admin` in your browser (e.g., `https://yoursite.com/admin`)
- The CMS interface will load automatically

## Content Structure

### 1. **Translations** 
Edit all UI text in both Dutch and English:
- Navigation labels
- Hero section text
- Form labels
- Footer text
- All static content

**Location:** `src/content/translations.nl.json` and `translations.en.json`

### 2. **Services**
Manage your service offerings:
- Service title
- Description
- Outcome statement
- Up to 6 services displayed with icons

**Location:** `src/content/services.nl.json` and `services.en.json`

### 3. **Pricing Packages**
Configure pricing tiers:
- Package name
- Price
- Delivery time
- Description
- Features list
- CTA button text
- Mark as "popular"

**Location:** `src/content/pricing.nl.json` and `pricing.en.json`

### 4. **Testimonials**
Add client testimonials:
- Author name
- Role
- Company
- Quote

**Location:** `src/content/testimonials/*.md` (Markdown files)

### 5. **Case Studies**
Showcase success stories:
- Project title
- Problem description
- Solution overview
- Results achieved
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Client quote

**Location:** `src/content/cases/*.md` (Markdown files)

## How to Edit Content

### Via CMS Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to `/admin`
2. Log in (requires Git Gateway setup)
3. Select the collection you want to edit
4. Make your changes
5. Click "Save" to commit changes

### Direct File Edit
You can also edit the JSON/Markdown files directly in your code editor:
- JSON files for structured data (translations, services, pricing)
- Markdown files for rich content (testimonials, case studies)
